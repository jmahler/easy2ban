easy2ban - Monitor log files and/or programs and ban IPs.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

easy2ban is used to create easy to configure daemons which monitor
log files and/or output of programs to find patterns (regex) which
indicate malicious activity.  And based on the rate of these matches
the IP can be banned or some other action can be taken.

This program is in very early stages of development.
It is currently only a crude proof of concept.
